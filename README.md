Hawk/Future Brain - AMOS retro games
=====================================

This repository contains the source code of some old games I made for the Amiga500 using AMOS Professional.

About Hawk/Future Brain
------------------------
* Hawk: my nickname in the demoscene when I was active.
* Future Brain: the name of our group in the demoscene.

About the source code
----------------------
* The source code of every program has been decoded from its original <code>.AMOS</code> file to plain text.
* I call this decoded file _plain AMOS file_, and use the extension <code>.pamos</code> for it.
* I have used my own tool to decode the source programs: https://github.com/endavid/AMOSaver
* Labels and variables are shown in small letters, instead of the original block letters used in AMOS Professional editor.

Directory structure
-------------------
* Each folder contains a different game.
